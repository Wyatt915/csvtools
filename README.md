# csvtools
A simple CLI application for basic spreadsheet manipulation

The primary inspiration for this project came from being frustrated with the relative clunkiness of many spreadsheet programs.  Specifically, csvtools is for in-place manipulation of spreadsheet data in the command line - no more having to use extra columns for calculations.  Another feature is quick ASCII graph drawing to get a feel for what the data is doing.

This is all still very much a work in progress.
