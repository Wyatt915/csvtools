# CSVTools Todo List

- [x] Make histogram::rawdata into a reference to a dataset instead of being an entire copy of a potentially huge array.

- [ ] some actual csv file parsing might be nice

- [ ] input a mathematical expression to be applied to an entire column using exprtk

- More column manipulations as I think of them
